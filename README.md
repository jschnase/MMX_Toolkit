# MMX Toolkit V0.1.0

This is the pre-release repository for code, data, and other resources related to NASA's MMX Toolkit. The code set implements an automated retrospective ecological niche modeling (ENM) workflow. It is very much a research platform and is in active development. We make the MMX Toolkit available here without technical support. For more information about the software, please see the Guide.pdf file above or documentation in the resources/docs folder. This software is intended to be used for educational purposes only and is provided "AS IS" without any warranty of any kind. For more information about the project, please contact john.l.schnase@nasa.gov.
