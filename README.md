# MMX Toolkit V0.1.0

This is the pre-release repository for code, data, and other resources related to NASA's MMX Toolkit development effort. The code set implements an automated retrospective ecological niche modeling (ENM) workflow. It is very much a research platform and is in active development. We make the MMX Toolkit available here without technical support of any kind. For more information about the software, please see the Guide.pdf file above or documentation in the resources/docs folder. For more information about the project, please contact john.l.schnase@nasa.gov or mark.carroll@nasa.gov.
