# MMX_Toolkit_V0.0
 Prototype MMX Toolkit for BiDS'23 Submission Review

For now, this directory is a placeholder. If the paper describing the MMX Toolkit is accepted for the BiDS '23 Conference, the directory will become the publicly-accessible repository for code, data, and other resouces we intend to release with V0.0 of the Toolkit. Publication date will coincide with the BiDS '23 Conference. Please email john.l.schnase@nasa.gov for additional information.

Many thanks,
